# NeuroKit2 Enhancements – Turing Practice Task

This repository documents enhancements made to the [NeuroKit2](https://github.com/neuropsychology/NeuroKit) open-source project as part of the Turing Practice Task Assessment. The goal was to demonstrate production-level engineering by analyzing a real Python codebase, identifying improvement opportunities, and delivering tested, high-quality enhancements.

##  Project Overview

**Original Repository**: [neuropsychology/NeuroKit](https://github.com/neuropsychology/NeuroKit)  
**Language**: Python  
**Stars**: ~1.9K  
**Domain**: Neurophysiological Signal Processing (ECG, EDA, RSP, etc.)

##  Enhancements Implemented

### 1.  Asynchronous Signal Processing
- Converted `bio_process()` and related signal functions to support `async`/`await`.
- Enabled non-blocking, real-time processing for streaming use cases.
- Backward-compatible with existing synchronous workflows.

### 2.  Command-Line Interface (CLI)
- Added a `cli.py` module using `argparse`.
- Enables users to process signals via terminal with commands like:
  ```bash
  python cli.py --input data.csv --output results.csv --signals ecg eda
  ```

### 3.  Shared Signal Utilities Refactor
- Extracted common functions (e.g., normalize, resample) into a shared module.
- Reduced code duplication and improved maintainability across signal types.

##  Testing & Quality Assurance

- Framework: `pytest` with `pytest-cov` and `pytest-asyncio`
- Test Coverage: >90% for new code
- Static Analysis: Configured with `pylint`
- Linting rules: See `.pylintrc`
